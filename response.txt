You're looking for information on exercise 1. Can I help you with that? You asked where exercise 1 is taught and how much content is covered in that part of the course.

Let me check the video chunks for you. It seems like there are two videos where exercise 1 is mentioned: Video 1 (starts at around 1250 seconds) and Video 2 (starts at around 160 seconds). However, I don't have information on how much content is covered in those exercises.

To give you a better idea, if you want to know more about the first video where exercise 1 is taught, you can check out Video 1. It starts playing from the 12:10 mark (around 1250 seconds).

Would you like me to guide you further on that?
