    "text": " From today's video, we will start the Sigma Web Development course. Like this video with high energy, because in this video, I am going to make you a profitable web developer from zero. This course will be very modern because web development has changed over time. A lot of new things have come, a lot of things have come in JavaScript that make work very easy. A lot of technologies have come that will make your work very easy. This course will be for those people who know nothing. You know zero if this course is for you about web development. We will start from zero, but in the future we will raise the bar like anything. What will we learn in this course, I will tell you in a while. Web development is a very profitable thing. I have personally earned a lot of money through web development. And I believe that you can also be very successful by learning web development. During the course, you will be given notes, cheat sheets, references, all these things. This course is going to be a little different because I will tell you all the technologies that you should learn according to your experience in this course. And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies. The course content will be complete web development, front-end, back-end, database. I will teach you as much as you want to learn. I will tell you what exactly the course content will be in a while. But you guys have faith that I will make you a full-stack developer. A lot of projects will be done for you in the course. And at the end of the course, we will make some good projects. So that your grip on web development can become very strong. According to me, project-based learning is the best way to learn. That's why I will make a lot of projects for you. And if you agree, then write in the comment section below, I agree. Because when you comment, I get a smile on my face. So do comment. I want to assure you that after finishing this course, you will be able to make any kind of website from start to end. And during this course, I will make a lot of websites for you so that your confidence will go up a lot. So let's start with the first video of our Sigma web development course. Let's roll the intro. Intro Alright guys, so I have come to my computer screen. And now follow me as I am doing. I have downloaded the Google Chrome browser here. You also download the Google Chrome browser. I am not saying that it will not work. But you guys have to do exactly the same as a beginner. What I am doing here. So here we will follow exactly as I am doing. And as the videos come along, you will be able to follow exactly. I will go to Google quickly. And I will write here. Download VS Code Now what is this VS Code? VS Code is a source code editor. If I am in Windows, then I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system. Then you can download it for that strange operating system. And the process will be exactly the same. You can see that VS Code has come here in my Downloads folder. And here you can see that this setup has been downloaded. I will refresh here. And here you can see that I can double-click the VS Code setup and install it. So simply install VS Code. It is as easy as installing a game. You read the agreement quickly here. This license applies to... Damages And after this I will accept the agreement. You also read it like me. And I am the fastest reader in the world. I am the fastest reader in the world. Next we will do. It is important to check both icons here. It is very important to check both icons. Check it. If you want a desktop shortcut. That is, if you want to get a shortcut on the desktop here. Click on the Create a Desktop icon. And after this we will do next. Then we will install. If your PC is fast like me, then it will be this fast. But if your PC is slow. Then there is no problem. It will be a little slow install. Nothing more than this will happen. Now here I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel. Because these videos. I want you to follow exactly. As soon as I put the video, you get a notification. So if you want to follow this course completely. Ideally you should subscribe. With that said, our VS Code has been downloaded. I have opened my VS Code. Don't be afraid to see this. Beginners, don't be afraid to see this. And I am saying this again. If you already know things. We are taking a beginner friendly start here. In the initial videos. But we will raise the bar like anything. In the upcoming videos. So stay tuned. Hi. Okay, I will request you guys. Tell me in the comment section. What is your level? Are you a beginner, advanced or an intermediate user? Tell me in the comment section. How much do you know about web development? Beginner, advanced, intermediate. Please. You guys do comment. Now what is VS Code here? Why did we download it? Let's understand this. So if you are a beginner. You don't know what VS Code is. Let me tell you that VS Code is a code editor. Which helps you to edit code. Now you will say. Harry, I can edit code in notepad. So yes, do it in notepad. It will also happen. Yes, I am not saying sarcastically. It will happen in that too. Here we set it up. And show what is in it. Which makes it a little different from notepad. Look here. We set it up quickly. I will not browse here with color themes. In fact, I do it. I keep dark modern here. My theme. And I did all this. Next section. After this next section. If you want, you can also close this welcome. But again here are some tips. Telling you. That's it. This is your VS Code here. It has started. This is the screen of VS Code. You can see. You can make a new file here. You can make a new folder. But I will recommend you. That you close it. Yes, you close it. Why did you close it? I am going to make a new folder here. And I am going to keep it in its name. You guessed it right. Sigma Web Development Course. And we will do everything in this course. We will do everything. We will do everything. Means understand. We will do related to the course. We will not do much. Now here you will press shift and right click. If you are in windows. So you can see here. That an option called open with code is coming. This option called open with code. Helps you to open this particular folder in VS Code. You will select it here. Now what will you do here? You will say yes I trust this file. Click on it here. Yes I trust the authors. And this folder has now opened. Means if I click on plus. To make a new file. Suppose I have written here. Index.html Write it now. Even if you don't know what I am writing. Write it. Hit enter. And after this. What will I do? That I will write here. Hey I am your first html file. Suppose I have written this. Here you can see this dot. This dot is white in color. This dot means. That you have not saved this file. Please save it. Hit ctrl s. It will be saved. I will recommend you. That you go to the file. And enable the auto save option here. So as you type. You will not see this dot. Your file will be saved instantly. As you type. And I also recommend this thing. We will not use ctrl s. Otherwise if you want to save with ctrl s. Then you can disable this option. One more thing I would like to do with you. You click on gear here. Then click on settings. And search here mouse. Mouse. Now see here. Editor mouse wheel zoom. Check this. What will happen by checking this? I will tell you. Check this and close it in settings. Now you don't have to be afraid. What is VS code? Why is VS code? How is it? What is this? Why is this? What is this news? Yes, but you don't have to see all this. Now you will simply press ctrl. And scroll like this. So what happens? That your font size. It changes. Now I will show you a magic. What is magic? It is a very simple logic. That here in downloads. In the folder named sigma web development course. What happened? That this file was made. Index dot html. Which is very natural. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is also made here. I will make another file here. Suppose I make a file named this dot txt. I will write this is this. So what will happen? This file will be made here too. So this folder and this VS code. Both are running in sync. Now if I open this file from here. From the notepad. And I will show you. My file is opened in the notepad. So I can do that too. That is also my choice. But I will not use the notepad. Because there are some things in VS code. Which notepad does not give me. And I want that I get those features. I do not want to overwhelm you. But I show you. What is there in VS code? Which you do not get in the notepad. If I write here. Suppose html. If I hit enter. Then it automatically. It gave me the opening and closing tag. If I hit the exclamation mark here. Then it gives me a boilerplate template. If I click on it. Then see the basic code of html. It came here. We will discuss about it later. Now you do not get overwhelmed by it. But I want to tell you. How it is beneficial in VS code. Why we did not use notepad. Why we used VS code. And this feel comes. We are getting such a good feel. The developer's feel is coming. The hacker's feel is coming. That feel is also important. That is why the confidence will come. To do coding. Now for mac and linux users. I want to comment here. Exactly similar things are going to happen. For you too. I am using windows. Because I have a windows laptop. I can not use three laptops. I can not use linux, mac and windows. I can not use all three at once. So for you. Exactly the same things will be there. In fact I should say. Similar things will be there. Not exactly the same. Very similar things will be there. So you can follow along. Very easily. So do not take tension. I will tell you about some extensions. And you will enjoy. By using those extensions. And you will also say. It is fun. What did you recommend. But I will tell you in a while. And this is criminally underrated. I am telling you. You will enjoy. I would like to tell you before that. You will click on the right. Click on the command palette. So here are a lot of options for VS code. You do not need to know all these options. As we move forward in the course. Whatever feature. As it comes into use. I will keep telling you. And you guys use it. But what I will do here now. I will toggle a screencast mode. You do not have to do this. But I will do. You will know what will happen. I clicked. So you see I will type anything. If I press caps lock. So here caps lock will come. So you will know. Which button I pressed when. Now this thing is for you. Not at all relevant. But I just want to tell you. What is the screencast mode. What is the screencast mode. We can change its settings from here. Now here you see. Screencast mode's vertical offset. What does vertical offset mean? If I make vertical offset zero. So it came up. If I make vertical offset 70. So it came down. I will make it 60. I will make it 60. If I give space here. So it came here. If I make it 80. So it came here. That is. From bottom how much will it look up. So I made it zero. In fact I made it one. Now I will type anything here. Suppose I did this. It will show you at the bottom. Which is ideal. So what I will do is. I will close this file. I will close the settings tab. These are tabs basically. Like tabs in chrome. Your tabs are exactly the same. So I hope you know. What is it? What we have written about it. You will forget. I will tell you step by step. What is exactly what is it? You can also close the welcome page. Of VS Code. By any chance. If you want to zoom in on VS Code. Which I will do. Because I am recording a video. Now add control plus. Add the plus of numpad. Look below. I have shown you. I am zooming in. I am zooming in because. I am recording videos. So ideally I would like. That you can see the screen from close. But when I am doing my coding. Then I don't zoom in so much. Because you have to keep this thing in mind. So these are related to VS Code. Now I want to tell you. How do websites work? A website basically. Works through three types of people. Imagine three people. One is client. One is server. Who is client? Who is the other? Server. Who is the third? Browser. Who is also called Babu brother. Browser. So browser, client, server. What is this client? What is this server? What is this browser? I am the client. You. All of us. Who use a browser. Who is the browser? This is Chrome. Hello Chrome. I am the client. I will tell the client. When I write codewithharry.com. Suppose I write codewithharry.com. So what I basically say? I say. From this browser. Please give me codewithharry.com website. Or if I write here. Youtube.com I say. Give me youtube.com website. I say. Browser. Give me youtube.com. I want to see youtube. What does the browser say? You want youtube? Take this. So here. I will enter youtube.com. So from the server. Youtube.com. He brought it. Are you understanding? From the server. Youtube.com. He brought it. He showed me this screen by parsing. This work happened so soon. Because my internet.com. Internet.com. Internet speed is very fast. It is so less. Nowadays people are even faster. But still. According to my locality. It is very fast. Okay. So with this fast internet speed. All these things are very fast. So the client sends a request to the server. Through the browser. Browser is the client. That is my assistant. Whatever I say from the browser. He will do that. Will help me. From the server. To bring this web page. Who is managing the server? Server is being managed. Youtube. Youtube.com. Server is being managed. And inside that server. Some code is written. Which sends me. This kind of code. That is when I write. Youtube.com. This code came. Now how to convert this code. This work is of the browser. That is how to show me. This work is of the browser. So the client says to the browser. Hey kid. Give me youtube.com. Browser says. Kid you want youtube.com. Wait I will ask for youtube.com. Youtube.com. Then the browser goes to the server. Means a request is sent to the server. Server says. Give me youtube.com. Server will either give it. Or will say no. Or will say error. Or will say that the server has been errored. Whatever response will be. Ideally it should be 200. Response code is 200. With that response. Our browser. Comes back to the client. And shows this kind of page. I hope this is clear to you. Client. Browser. Server. So client to the browser. Browser to the server. Back to the browser. So this is how this thing works. This thing is a little more important. I will tell you once again. When you write google.com. Any website google.com. So client. Says to the browser. Give me google.com. Browser says. Hey teacher. You want google.com. Wait I will also bring it from the server. So goes to the server. Browser. And brings google.com. And gives you. You get google.com. Now with google.com. The server. All images. All videos. Whatever things are there. It sends all. Like these icons. These icons. The URL is also written in this code. And that too. The job of the browser. To display us properly. So the server. It sends a whole bundle to the browser. Sends this kind of bundle. And by passing this bundle. Showing like this. The job of the browser. Now whatever further interaction. User with this page. Browser will give additional request. If I do right click. And inspect. And then I go to the network. And here I write. Assume. Harry bhai. Assume I wrote Harry bhai. So see so many requests. He sent for images. And many more requests. He sent. So as you interact. Similarly. More requests. Additionally. Will have to send. To the browser. So in total. You consider it like a restaurant. You gave the order. Means sent the request. As soon as you gave the order. Your order. A waiter took it. That waiter. Then went inside the kitchen. He sent your order. Kitchen you consider the server. And after this. Finally when the kitchen. Gave the order back. So what did this waiter do. Which is the work of the browser. That waiter. He gave you back the order. It is possible that the order. Is not made in the kitchen. For some reason. It is very rare. That you order something. And you did not get it. But it happens sometimes. Similarly here. Sometimes it happens. That error is seen. 404 error. Or 500 error. Server is not working. Such errors. So whenever such errors. Are seen. Then also you are told. That the server is not working. So that's why. You are told. That the server is not working. But ideally. 200. Means. Ok response. And you get. Such a webpage. So you can. Consider it. Like a restaurant. So whenever you write. Google.com. Slash mail. So if google.com. Slash mail is available. Then it will show you. And if you write. Codewithari.com. Slash contact. So codewithari.com. Slash contact. If it is available. Then it will show you. If it is not available. Then it will show 404. Or if there is 500 error. Then it will show you. A page with 500. Whatever server. Will send. Then the server. Will send. Then the server. Will process the request. After this. The server. Will send the data. To the browser again. And whatever data. Was sent. The browser showed. To the client. Then the client did something. The browser sent. The same request to the server. Then the server sent. Whatever data. The server sent. To the client. And came back to the browser. And so on. So now you will say. All this is fine. But what is this backend? What does backend mean? Backend is. How the server. Is processing the request. Now if you. Have a lot of data. Then what will you do? Will you store. Every webpage of the blog. Separately. Or will you. Generate that content. Dynamically. You will generate. That content. Dynamically. I take the example of Google. If I search for Harry. Then you can see here. That the header of Google. Is this. Links. This format. Doesn't change at all. If I write here. Suppose. Shubham. Okay. Suppose I wrote Shubham. So as soon as I write Shubham. Now see. When I wrote Harry. His. Very similar. Content. I am showing Google. So what does Google do? The backend of Google's server. Backend. Processes. Data. In such a way. That he. This kind of HTML. For the corresponding query. Send. That is. When I write Shubham. Then send this. When I write Harry. Then send this. So the process of generating this thing. What system. Is happening. That is the backend. Now this backend. Can be Django. This backend. Can be Flask. This backend. Can be NodeJs. This backend. Can be PHP. This backend. Can be Ruby on Rails. And the database inside the backend. It is used. That is. The backend code. The client does not see. This is the frontend code. Which sends the server. And how did the server make this code? We do not know. Because this is running on the server. Code. If you are confused. Then do not be confused at all. You will understand all these things. We will see the backend. Now we understand. How does the frontend work? The frontend. It is primarily. Made up of three languages. HTML. CSS. And JavaScript. These three languages. Are used. To generate. The query. These three languages. Which are needed. If you are making a website. Every website. HTML. CSS. JavaScript. In most of the cases. It is needed. If you only use HTML. Then a very basic. The skeleton of the website. It is made. After that. When you use CSS. Then you can style it. Like this button. It looks like this. So only CSS. It is visible. Along with that. Here this button is visible. Red. Here this button. It is seen as curved. This is all. With the help of CSS. This is what you are seeing here. Edges. This is all. With the help of CSS. So the work of CSS. Is to style a page. Which button. What color will it be. What will happen by hovering. All these things. Are done through CSS. In a way. Beauty. Is CSS. HTML page. HTML is. The existence. Body of any page. Something like this. This is a standard. Which is agreed. If anyone makes a website. Then it will be made on HTML. So that the browser makers. Will understand. How to parse. The work of the browser. Is to parse. HTML. And HTML. Is a skeleton. This is a standard. Anyone who makes a website in this world. Will make it in HTML. Skeleton. HTML will use. This is a standard. Such a standard. Has been made. So that. Everyone. Make the same type of pages. And if anyone is making a browser. Then the same language. Have to parse. If as a beginner. You have learned 80% HTML. Then you are good to go. For web development. Now. Some things happen directly. From HTML. Like. If I write. A very quick HTML code. And show. So I am writing. HTML code. In this way. By hitting the exclamation mark. I have used. Emmet abbreviation. You guys. Don't worry at all. How I wrote this code. I will write. Hey. This is HTML. And I can open this HTML file. Directly. In this way. And as soon as I open this HTML file. Directly. Here. You see. It will open. In this way. I can open it directly. Actually. By double clicking. In this way. And it opened. Now see. Hey this is HTML. But it is not styled at all. That is. This HTML file. Is very basic. Now you can. I have an HTML file. Which I show you. With which you can run videos. I do one thing. That I show you. By changing this HTML file. Such that. We can show videos in it. So. There is a video tag in HTML. If you hit enter video. Then whatever video you put in SRC. It will be played. Like if I put here. Video 1.mp4. You see. VS code has automatically shown me. Video 1.mp4. This is the benefit. To use VS code. So you guys see here. I will reload it. So here this video. Is automatically seen. I can play it. To play. I can play it. I can play it. I can play it. To play. I have to write controls here. And I will refresh it now. So I will get the controls to play. I can play. Dude this ship has come. To sell. The man is in dire need. How does he want the case. He is asking for 130 crores. Final. Absolutely. Now if I put here. Video 2.mp4. I put video 1 here. I have two more videos outside. I have some more videos here. If I put it here. And after that. I refer them. If video 2.mp4. I put video 2.mp4. I put video 2.mp4. I put video 2.mp4. I put video 2.mp4. I put video 2.mp4. I put video 2.mp4. And after that. I refer them. If I put video 2.mp4. Instead of it. Then video 2 will be seen. I will reload and show you. What you bought. Why did you put it. So yes Ben Stokes. I put it. And now. With my own hands. By working hard. Show people. What did you do. These were Ben Stokes. Lookalike. Now if I put video 3 here. Assume I put video 3 here. So my third video. That will run. So I will reload it. And you see. I can play it. Sir. Give me something to eat. Sir. So this third video. We have run. I ran video 3.mp4 here. I will close it too. And in the same way. We can run video 4. And video 4 is a DJ video. I have. In which DJ is played. So you see. So these things. You can make. Only by using html. That is. You have to do something. There is no need. But you can do it with html. So you see. I have a DJ video.

In which DJ is playing. You can play videos, display images, all this can be done with html Now if you want to style it Like I want a border to come on it Or it comes in the background of a little red color So what do I have to do for it For that I have to use CSS CSS adds beauty to any website Then comes JavaScript Which adds interaction to you and gives you a website For example, what will happen when I click on search What will happen when I write code with Harry here Like code with Hr is written and here auto complete has come Why did a lot of things come here It came because a request went to the server And for this query, the results of auto complete came here So all these things are done with JavaScript We call it client-side scripting That is, if we want to do scripting in the client here If you want to code only on the client side Then we can do it with the help of JavaScript This is also a brain So our website becomes beauty with brain I am talking about the website Beauty with brain Beauty added from CSS And brain came from JavaScript Now JavaScript helps you easily make the page dynamic Like if you want to change the content without loading the page Then all this work is done with JavaScript A lot of mosquitoes are coming here So let me kill these mosquitoes here Oh, big brother, mosquitoes, nothing is happening to them from here My racket is working Oh my god Like the video because I also eat the sparks of current for you So when I was in college Someone told me that I have to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript one by one Learn 100% HTML first Then learn 100% CSS Until you remember all the properties Then learn JavaScript But this assumption is completely wrong Why is it wrong? Because HTML you guys only 80% And CSS you guys only 40-60% And JavaScript you guys only 50-70% You can start web development You can make projects And while making, you can move forward from there In this course, I will tell you about the impact of chat gpt and web development So we will also talk about this You guys stay tuned So never run after perfection With HTML and CSS Don't think that I will do HTML for one year Then I will do CSS next year Then in the third year I will do JavaScript Then in the fourth year I will make projects Never think like this Do HTML 80% CSS 40-60% And the JavaScript is 50-70% By learning You guys can make a very good website And as you keep making websites Your experience will teach you more HTML More CSS More JavaScript And you will not even know You must have perfected HTML, CSS, JavaScript While you are making money And working as a professional web developer So you guys are earning along with learning And along with that you are also improving your skills So never think that I will make a website only when I remember all the HTML tags I will make a website only when I remember all the CSS properties I will make a website only when I remember all the JavaScript I will teach you this much That matters We are going to learn what matters And I don't want you to learn for years That's why I have designed this course like this So that you are taught only what matters And you will learn the rest from practice And I am going to make you do a lot of practice in this course Here to learn the Sigma web development course 2-4 mosquitoes have also come Which is good Our audience is increasing In this course we will learn HTML first Then learn CSS Then learn JavaScript And I will tell you such tricks in this course Which you guys have not heard anywhere And I have learned different points of my career I will tell you in a course I have learned some amazing tricks in my career Very late And I want you to learn all the tricks as soon as you start Now if you have any doubts in this course In the coming videos You can use the hashtag doubt And ask your doubt I am going to try to answer all the doubts I will try My whole effort will be to solve your doubts So if you have any technical question You can definitely put the hashtag doubt And please in useless questions And in useless comments Do not put the hashtag doubt So that I can prioritize the reply of the hashtag doubt I will try to answer all the doubts As much as I can And you will get to learn everything in this course So like this course If you have not done it yet That will bring a smile on my face So do it Now what is react, next JS, Angular So see all these front end frameworks They help you to use JavaScript properly That is HTML, CSS, JavaScript HTML, CSS, JavaScript is the basis of the website They help to make this process fast How? We will learn it in this course Yes, we will learn it in this course I told you that I will make this course for you I will make you so good That I will take you from zero to web development I will take you to hero Tie your seat belt Because you have now bought the ticket of Sigma web development express I want to give you a very good analogy To teach HTML, CSS and JavaScript HTML is just like car skeleton After this, I have painted CSS And if I came to the internal engine car Than it is JavaScript See as an example of a person The skeleton is HTML After this, everything is CSS And brain is JavaScript That is, the nervous system is JavaScript Now I will take you to Forbes.com Now I will take you to Forbes.com As you go to Forbes A website has opened Forbes.com is a website Which uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript Just like any other website now if I click on inspect then inspect element is opened now you can see they have used script in head and to add css they have used link, so what I will do is I will remove their css to remove css, I will simply clear their style tags by using delete key so as soon as I remove all style tags so as soon as I delete all their style sheets see what has happened this page is looking like this, they have only raw html they have forgotten what should be the size of images and only raw html is written here which is not styled at all, so the condition of Forbes.com is like this without css, without css it is showing only raw buttons, raw text raw links and similarly by removing script tag I can see how this website will look without css now if I delete html tag of this page like this, I have deleted head and all so this is a blank page, without html it is not even there, so this is the role of html, css and javascript in making a webpage, for your information this course was initially made to be paid but I changed my mood and converted it into free course so I want you all to be serious many people have reached out to me to launch this course but I felt that this course should be kept free because when I used to learn web development I can understand when you don't have a good course to learn and you don't have affordability to buy a paid course so I can understand and I decided that this is a sigma web development course and it should be launched absolutely free this course is free but under this free plan you will earn crores of rupees you will give me tea, coffee, parties and all the gifts this is our agreement in this video so when you start earning crores of rupees, then send me a green card or maybe a red card, but you have to do this only when you start earning good so just keeping you aside in the next video, I will tell you how you can earn money to complete this course this is also important how I do freelancing how clients come I will tell you everything A to Z I want to tell you some action items first action item is to access this course's playlist everyone bookmark this playlist click on star button and open this playlist click on save button and save it many of you said that we will buy the course even if it is paid I believe in your love and trust but this course is going to be free there should not be any technical issues I am uploading this video in 1080p so you should see it clearly many people say that the video is in HD you watch Bali ka Wadhu you watch Bali ka Wadhu from morning to evening and then you say that your videos are not HD call Nagar Palika I hope you understood the request how these websites work we got a basic idea how client-server interaction works we will see how the website is made we will make our first website in the next video so you should be excited because our first website is going to be made so access the playlist"
